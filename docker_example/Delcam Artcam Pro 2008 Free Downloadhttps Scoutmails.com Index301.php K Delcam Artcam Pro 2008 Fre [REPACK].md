Delcam ArtCAM Pro 2008 SP5 has many features that make it a powerful and versatile software for artistic CADCAM. Some of these features are:

- A new file type called the 3D Project that allows the user to create multiple models within a single project and arrange them to create larger assemblies or divide them into separate files for manufacturing in different materials.
- A new 3D offset strategy that gives a much better surface finish with harder materials, such as when machining production tooling or engraving decorations into moulds.
- A new Machining Wizard that simplifies the setting-up of multi-axis machining of complex models, such as those created from 3D Projects or imported from other CAD systems.
- A new option that allows models to be sliced into layers that can be machined individually and then assembled, such as when producing large-scale sculptures or furniture.
- A wide range of 3D modelling tools that allow the user to create realistic and artistic shapes from images, vectors, text, or basic primitives.
- The ability to import solid and surface data from the full range of CAD systems supported by the Delcam Exchange data translation service, such as CATIA, Unigraphics, Pro/Engineer, SolidWorks, AutoCAD Inventor and Solid Edge.

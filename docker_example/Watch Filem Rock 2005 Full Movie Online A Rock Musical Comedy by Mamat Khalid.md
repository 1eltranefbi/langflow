However, these games are not free to play. You need to purchase them from the official website of Lavamind Games[^1^], or from other online platforms such as Steam or GOG. The prices range from $9.99 to $19.99 per game, depending on the edition and the platform. If you want to play all three games, you might have to spend a lot of money.
  
Fortunately, there is a way to play these games for free, or at least for a lower price. You can use a tool called Lucky Patcher[^2^], which is a free Android app that can mod many apps and games, block ads, remove unwanted system apps, backup apps before and after modifying, move apps to SD card, remove license verification from paid apps and games, and more.

Da cosa nasce cosa (From thing to thing) is a book by Bruno Munari, one of the most influential Italian designers and artists of the 20th century. The book, first published in 1981, is a collection of notes and reflections on the design process, from the initial idea to the final product. Munari offers practical advice and insights on how to approach design problems, how to use materials and techniques, how to communicate with clients and users, and how to evaluate the quality and functionality of a design.
 
The book is divided into four parts: the first one deals with the definition and scope of design, the second one with the analysis and research of design problems, the third one with the development and testing of design solutions, and the fourth one with the presentation and documentation of design projects. Each part contains examples and case studies from Munari's own experience as well as from other designers and fields of application. The book is richly illustrated with drawings, sketches, diagrams, photographs, and prototypes that show Munari's creative process and his attention to detail.

Da cosa nasce cosa is not only a manual for designers, but also a manifesto for a design culture that is based on curiosity, experimentation, innovation, and social responsibility. Munari advocates for a design that is not driven by fashion or personal taste, but by a rational and scientific method that aims at solving real needs and improving human life. He also encourages designers to be aware of their role in society and to use their skills and creativity for positive change.
 
Da cosa nasce cosa is a classic text that has inspired generations of designers and students around the world. It is available in PDF format online for free download from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. It has also been translated into several languages, including English (Design as Art), Spanish (De lo visible a lo invisible), Portuguese (Das coisas nascem coisas), French (De la chose Ã  la chose), German (Von der Sache zur Sache), and Japanese (ç©ããç©ã¸).
  
In addition to his work as a designer, Munari was also a prolific author and educator. He wrote more than 60 books on various topics, such as art, design, creativity, communication, games, and children's literature. Some of his most famous titles are Fantasia (1948), Artista e designer (1966), Codice ovvio (1971), and Da cosa nasce cosa (1981). He also created many innovative books for children, such as Nella notte buia (1956), Le storie di Munari (1960), and I prelibri (1972).
 
Munari was also involved in many educational projects and workshops for children and adults, both in Italy and abroad. He believed that everyone has a creative potential that can be stimulated and developed through playful and experimental activities. He devised many methods and tools for fostering creativity, such as the Xerografia d'autore (1963), the Scatole abitacolo (1966), the Libri illeggibili (1967), and the Tavole tattili (1978). He also collaborated with various institutions and organizations, such as UNESCO, MoMA, Triennale di Milano, and Reggio Children.
 
Munari died in Milan in 1998, at the age of 90. His legacy is still alive and influential today, as many designers, artists, educators, and researchers continue to draw inspiration from his work and vision. His works are part of many public and private collections around the world, such as MoMA in New York, Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Centre Pompidou in Paris, Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan, and Museo del Novecento in Florence.
